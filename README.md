# CKME136 Toronto Property Price Prediction

Choosing a property to purchase in Toronto is a complex decision that many people will face throughout their lives.  This is a very difficult decision for several reasons:

1.	People do not purchase properties often so they do not have much practice or experience at evaluating property prices and features
2.	It is a highly localized problem as prices, features, and locations will vastly differ between cities so learnings from Boston cannot be applied to Toronto
3.	The real estate industry in Toronto has not made data easily available for buyers to make informed decisions (releasing data on password protected sites in past months)

To solve this problem for fellow Torontonians I am proposing a Toronto property price prediction tool that will scrape Toronto-focused property listing website for data points including selling price data, comparable property sold prices, house features and location data to build a model that can predict house prices.  This tool will deliver three key results:

1.	A data pipeline to extract Toronto real estate data and most importantly, selling price data that is not readily available
2.	Descriptive analytics on the Toronto real estate environment to better inform buyers and sellers
3.	A regression model that will accurately predict Toronto house listing prices to inform buyers about favourable prices and help sellers to set their own selling prices
